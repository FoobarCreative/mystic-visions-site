# Privacy Policy

This following document sets forth the Privacy Policy for the _Mystic Visions_ website and app, produced by _Foobar Creative_.

_Foobar Creative_ is committed to providing you with the best possible customer service experience. _Foobar Creative_ is bound by the Privacy Act 1988 (Cth) (Australia), which sets out a number of principles concerning the privacy of individuals.

### Collection of your personal information

Viewing the website does not collect any personal information. Using the iOS app will save information entered into the welcome chat to personalise the experience for you. If you email us, then we will have a record of your email address.

This website uses Google Analytics, and the iOS apps covered use Google Analytics and potentially the Facebook SDK.

### Sharing of your personal information

We may occasionally hire other companies to provide services on our behalf, including but not limited to handling customer support enquiries, processing transactions or customer freight shipping. Those companies will be permitted to obtain only the personal information they need to deliver the service. _Foobar Creative_ takes reasonable steps to ensure that these organisations are bound by confidentiality and privacy obligations in relation to the protection of your personal information.

### Use of your personal information

For each app user, we expressively collect the following non-personally identifiable information, including but not limited to user locale, version and language, operating system, pages viewed while using the app, and crash logs. This collected information is used solely internally for the purpose of performance monitoring of the app and fixing bugs.

From time to time, we may use customer information for new, unanticipated uses not previously disclosed in our privacy notice. If our information practices change at some time in the future we will use for these new purposes only, data collected from the time of the policy change forward will adhere to our updated practices.

### Changes to this Privacy Policy

_Foobar Creative_ reserves the right to make amendments to this Privacy Policy at any time. If you have objections to the Privacy Policy, you should not access or use the Site.

### Accessing Your Personal Information

You have a right to access your personal information, subject to exceptions allowed by law. If you would like to do so, please let us know. You may be required to put your request in writing for security reasons. _Foobar Creative_ reserves the right to charge a fee for searching for, and providing access to, your information on a per request basis.

### Contacting us

_Foobar Creative_ welcomes your comments regarding this Privacy Policy. If you have any questions about this Privacy Policy and would like further information, please [contact us via email](mailto:support@mysticvisions.app).
